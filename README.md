## Preparation

Before you can get started you must ensure NVIDIA drivers are installed on the host system:
This is done using the following steps:  
These steps have been taken from [here](https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/nvidia-drivers-instalation-proxmox-and-ct.156421/).

1. Blacklist the nouveau drivers (this will create a new file):
   ```
   nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf
   ```
   Paste this inside:
   ```
   blacklist nouveau
   options nouveau modeset=0
   ```

2. Update initramfs:
   ```
   update-initramfs -u
   ```

3. Check if nouveau is enabled
   ```
   lsmod | grep nouveau
   ```
   If it gives output, disable it with the following command:
   ```
   rmmod nouveau
   ```
   Afterwards go back and verify it's actually disabled by running the following command again:
   ```
   lsmod | grep nouveau
   ```

4. Make sure your system can find your NVIDIA GPU:
   ```
   lspci | grep NVIDIA
   ```

5. Download the latest nvidia driver for your GPU [link](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/) where the OS is **Linux 64-bit**. Make sure the drivers are compatible with nvidia-utils-xxx-server. Example:
   ```
   wget https://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/550.90.07/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-550.90.07.run
   chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-550.90.07.run
   ```

6. Install the required build packages:
   ```
   apt install build-essential pve-headers-$(uname -r)
   ```

7. Run the installation:
   ```
   ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-550.90.07.run
   ```

8. Verify the drivers installed succesfully and continue to the [Installation](#Installation)
   ```
   nvidia-smi
   ```
